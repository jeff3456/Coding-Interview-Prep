# Coding-Interview-Prep
This is a repo dedicated to logging all of the coding interview questions I will practice.

##Plan
The questions will be found here:
* https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/20ahfq/heres_a_pretty_big_list_of_programming_interview/
* http://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2011/06/top-programming-interview-questions.html
* http://www.dsalgo.com/2013/02/index.php.html
* //www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850/ref=dp_ob_title_bk

Most solutions will be coded in java.
